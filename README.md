Enjoy using [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/) with [NVIDIA game streaming](https://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience) but annoyed with not being able to switch out of a full screen game?

You may have heard of using [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) to remap some key to the Windows key, but unfortunately it is detected by some anti-cheat systems.

This project is original code that will let you press F8 to bring up the start menu while in game, and avoids detection by XIGNCODE. It must be manually run as administrator, then it stays silently in the background waiting for you to press F8.
